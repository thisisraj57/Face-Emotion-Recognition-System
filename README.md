# Face-Emotion-Recognition-System

INTRODUCTION

A Facial expression is the visible manifestation of the affective state, cognitive activity, intention, personality and psychopathology of a person and plays a communicative role in interpersonal relations. Human facial expressions can be easily classified into 7 basic emotions: happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust, and neutral. Our facial emotions are expressed through activation of specific sets of facial muscles. These sometimes subtle, yet complex, signals in an expression often contain an abundant amount of information about our state of mind. Automatic recognition of facial expressions can be an important component of natural human machine interfaces; it may also be used in behavioral science and in clinical practice. It has been studied for a long period of time and obtained progress in recent decades. Though much progress has been made, recognizing facial expressions with a high accuracy remains to be difficult due to the complexity and varieties of facial expressions. On a day to day basis humans commonly recognize emotions by characteristic features, displayed as a part of a facial expression. For instance happiness is undeniably associated with a smile or an upward movement of the corners of the lips. Similarly other emotions are characterized by other deformations typical to a particular expression.

The objective of this project is to develop an Automatic Facial Expression Recognition System which can take human facial images containing some expression as input and recognize and classify it into seven different expression classes such as : 
Neutral 
Angry 
Disgust 
Fear 
Happy
Sadness 
Surprise
